## ‚≠ê Overview

&nbsp;

### **The challenge:**

The challenge was to create calculator that will count the potential profit or loss of owned currencies .

### **Installation üíø**

The project uses [node](https://nodejs.org/en/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [CRA](https://create-react-app.dev/) and [whatwg-fetch](https://github.com/github/fetch).

Having them installed, type into the terminal: 
```
npm i
```
Then, you may run webpack typing in the terminal:

```
npm start
```

App is available using the following addresses:

http://localhost:3000

### **Solutions provided in the project:**
- HTML:
    - The project was built using semantic HTML5 markup.
- CSS:
    - The css styles are created using `styled-components`.
    
- JS:
    - ES2015+ (arrow functions, destructuring, spread operator) was used.
    - Communication with API is based on `fetch()` method.
    - To run the project using browsers that do not support `fetch()` method, package `whatwg-fetch` was used.    
    - Data during working app are saved and store in `localStorage` built into a web browser
    - All fields are validated also using `regex`.
- React:
    - The following hooks were used: `useState`, `useEffect`.
    - Components are split and kept in smaller ones.
- Redux: 
    - The state is managed with Redux, using a separate storage for `localStorage` data and for the `API`. Combine it with `.combineReducers()`.
    - The following hooks were used: `useSelector`, `useDispatch`.

I had opted to use `styled-components` as a solution for managing the CSS.

To make coding with `styled-component` more comfortable, I used a special Extension in Visual Studio Code `vscode-styled-components`.

I used the `createGlobalStyle` function from styled-components and added reset style and some global styles (`Reset.js` and `Global.js`)

```
import {createGlobalStyle} from 'styled-components';
import robotoRegularWoff from "./../fonts/roboto-regular-webfont.woff";
import robotoRegularWoff2 from "./../fonts/roboto-regular-webfont.woff2";
 .....
const GlobalStyle = createGlobalStyle
    ...
    @font-face {
        font-family: "Roboto";
        font-style: regular;
        font-weight: 400;
        src:
        url(${robotoRegularWoff2}) format('woff2'),
        url(${robotoRegularWoff}) format('woff');
    }
```

#### Data storage

 &nbsp;

The data (cuuency price) are loaded from API, communication is based on `fetch()` method. Data during working app are saved and store in [localStorage](http://kursjs.pl/kurs/storage/storage.php) built into a web browser. The state is managed with Redux, using a separate storage for `localStorage` data and for the `API`. Combine it with `.combineReducers()`

```
const reducers = combineReducers({
    exchange: exchangeReducer,
    wallet: walletReducer
})
 ------
const preloadedState = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('savings')) || undefined;

const store = createStore(reducers,preloadedState, composeWithDevTools(applyMiddleware(thunk)));

store.subscribe(()=>{
    const state = store.getState();
    localStorage.setItem('savings', JSON.stringify(state))
})
```

### **Ideas to develop the app:**

One of the idea to develop the app is to add component with graphic representation (chart) showing the level of profit or loss separately for each owned currency.
